- [x] llama.cpp
- [x] ollama

<br>

## üöÄ Installation

### üì• Binary releases

You can download the pre-built binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/pythops/tenere/releases)

### üì¶ crates.io

`tenere` can be installed from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tenere)

```shell
cargo install tenere
```

### ‚öíÔ∏è Build from source

To build from the source, you need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) compiler and
[Cargo package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

Once Rust and Cargo are installed, run the following command to build:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This will produce an executable file at `target/release/tenere` that you can copy to a directory in your `$PATH`.

### üç∫Brew

On macOS, you can use brew:

```bash
brew tap pythops/tenere
brew install tenere
```

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Tenere can be configured using a TOML configuration file. The file should be located in :

- Linux : `$HOME/.config/tenere/config.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tenere/config.toml`
- Mac : `$HOME/Library/Application Support/tenere/config.toml`
- Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/tenere/config.toml`


### General settings

Here are the available general settings:

- `archive_file_name`: the file name where the chat will be saved. By default it is set to `tenere.archive`
- `llm`: the llm model name. Possible values are:
  - `chatgpt`
  - `llamacpp`
  - `ollama`

```toml
archive_file_name = "tenere.archive"
llm  = "chatgpt"
```

### Key bindings

Tenere supports customizable key bindings.
You can modify some of the default key bindings by updating the `[key_bindings]` section in the configuration file.
Here is an example with the default key bindings

```toml
[key_bindings]
show_help = '?'
show_history = 'h'
new_chat = 'n'
save_chat = 's'
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note

> To avoid overlapping with vim key bindings, you need to use `ctrl` + `key` except for help `?`.

## Chatgpt

To use `chatgpt` as the backend, you'll need to provide an API key for OpenAI. There are two ways to do this:

Set an environment variable with your API key:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUTR KEY HERE"
```

Or

Include your API key in the configuration file:

```toml
[chatgpt]
openai_api_key = "Your API key here"
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
```

The default model is set to `gpt-3.5-turbo`. Check out the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) for more info.

## llama.cpp

To use `llama.cpp` as the backend, you'll need to provide the url that points to the server :

```toml
[llamacpp]
url = "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions"
```

If you configure the server with an api key, then you need to provide it as well:

Setting an environment variable :

```shell
export LLAMACPP_API_KEY="YOUTR KEY HERE"
```

Or

Include your API key in the configuration file:

```toml
[llamacpp]
url = "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions"
api_key = "Your API Key here"
```

More infos about llama.cpp api [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/server/README.md)

## Ollama

To use `ollama` as the backend, you'll need to provide the url that points to the server with the model name :

```toml
[ollama]
url = "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
model = "Your model name here"
```
